# Project Description

## To run this project:

Do `npm install`
then `npm run dev`

### High level objective:
Design and implement a component for visualizing items on a timeline.

### Completed Tasks:
- Display the items of each timeline in a different row according to the "assignLine" logic
- Enable zoom in/out functionality
- Display item's details on click

### Attempted not completed
- Drag and drop
- Editing of items

### Selected technologies:
- ReactJs
- Vite
- Typescript

### What I like about my implementation
- Clear and simple code
- Context for a single place of thruth / where editing the content's dates and content would have been possible and simple
- Easy to understand and navigate UX
- Nice design picked from some options searched in Dribbble like: https://dribbble.com/shots/14002364-Timeline-interactions or https://dribbble.com/shots/23894221-Timeline-Project-View

### What could have been improved
- more time to deliver editing of dates and drag and drop
- was already creating a Grid of drop handlers that would allow the user to drop the event on the date they wished for
